# Data Analysis on Social Media Campaign Data

[My other excel and powerBI projects](https://github.com/ZehraArshad/Excel_PowerBI_Github/tree/main)

## Data Cleaning: <br/>
* Campaign Column had "*Increaese$sales" 
    * Fixed that using the substitute column
* Data in two separate sheets
    * Used Vlookup to combine data using Campaign_Id as common key
* Other messy instances of data include
    * Divine DineLosAngles (Merged company and location)
    * Some numeric columns were string
